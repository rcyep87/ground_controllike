== README for Ground-Controllike

I was inspired to make this application to deepen my understanding of databases/activerecord while coming up with my own version of a "internal" baseball scouting & analytics application. Hence the name Ground Controllike, named after the internal scouting analytics platform of the Houston Astros.

Having an issue with navbar not displaying on the created controller/view I made that did not involve scaffold. Decided to start new project called [Player-Tracker] (https://github.com/rcyep87/Player-Tracker) so that I wouldn't lose the commit history.
